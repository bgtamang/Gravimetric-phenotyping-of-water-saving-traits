This folder named "AICc method" contains 26 files, each representing data for one of 26 Barley germplasms. After, these germplasms
were phenotyped for daytime canopy conductance in response to sequentially increasing VPD and transpiration rate computed, these values
transferred to Graph Pad Prism software where two statistical models were fitted for each genotype. Linear regression vs segmental regression
were compared and best models were selected based on Akaika Information Criteria (AIC- Akaike (1973) and AICc- AIC refined by Hurvich and Tsai (1989)).

To obtain only necessary parameter values from these files, R script named "Extracting model parameters" is used and the information put together in
a single file for downstream computation.
