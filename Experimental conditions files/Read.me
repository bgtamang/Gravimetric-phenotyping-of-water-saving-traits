We also need to record the experimental weather condition during the experiments to prepare tables (See Table 3 in manuscript).
This folder contains two metadata files.
1. VPD metadata file that has temperature, RH and VPD timecourse data for all experiments, chambers, loggers and days.
2. Weather metadata file has all the information on which weather loggers were in which chamber, on what day etc.

# The R-script associated with this folder is named VPD.Temp.RH computation.
