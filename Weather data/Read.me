This folder contains 9 .txt files. These are raw data from weather loggers employed across three growth chambers (3 sensors per chamber).
These loggers record temperature and relative humidity at canopy height so that vapor pressure deficit can be computed using these values.
VPD values are used as X-axis while transpiration rate is Y-axis during linear vs segmental slope computation and comparison.

R scripts to compute VPD for each file is available named "Compute VPD on weather data".
