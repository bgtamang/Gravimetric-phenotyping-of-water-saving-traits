This folder contains 54 .csv files generated through weight loggers. We employ 3 growth chambers for phenotyping crops for TR response to VPD.
Each chamber contain 18 precision weighing balances attached with weight loggers. These balances log the weight of pots each minute. The values
from these loggers are then used to compute transpiration rate by normalizing with leaf areas.

R script is avaiable to compute these values named "Compute TR on Weight data".
